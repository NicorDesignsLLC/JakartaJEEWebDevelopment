To demonstrate Tomcat 9 clustering on a Windows 10/11 machine with Tomcat 9 installed and launched from within Eclipse, you can follow the official documentation provided in the "Clustering/Session Replication How-To" guide. Here's a step-by-step guide based on this document for our set up:

1. **Prepare Your Environment:**

   	-  Ensure you have Tomcat 9 installed on your Windows 10/11 machine.
   	
   	-  Have Eclipse IDE installed and configured.

2. **Edit Tomcat Server Configuration:**

    - Open your Tomcat server configuration in Eclipse.
     
 	 	- Locate the `server.xml` file within your Tomcat installation directory (usually under `<Tomcat_Home>/conf`).

3. **Enable Clustering:**

     - In the `server.xml` file, find the `<Engine>` or `<Host>` element where you want to enable 	clustering.
	 - Add the following line inside the selected element to enable clustering:
	     ```xml
	     <Cluster className="org.apache.catalina.ha.tcp.SimpleTcpCluster"/>
	     ```
	 - This configuration enables all-to-all session replication using the `DeltaManager`.

4. **Adjust Configuration (Optional):**

	 - You can modify the cluster configuration as needed based on your requirements. Refer to the documentation for more advanced configurations.

5. **Start Tomcat Servers:**

	 - Start two instances of Tomcat (e.g., TomcatA and TomcatB) from Eclipse. Ensure they run on different ports and have unique names.

6. **Test Session Replication:**

	 - Create a simple web application in Eclipse.
	 - In your `web.xml`, ensure you have the `<distributable/>` element to mark the web application as distributable.

7. **Deploy and Access the Web Application:**

	   - Deploy your web application to both TomcatA and TomcatB.
	   - Access your web application in a web browser.

8. **Simulate Failover:**

     - To demonstrate session replication and failover, perform actions that create sessions (e.g., login, set session attributes) on one Tomcat instance (TomcatA).
     - Stop TomcatA abruptly to simulate a crash.

9. **Observe Failover:**
     - Access your web application again after TomcatA has crashed.
     - You should see that session data is maintained, demonstrating successful failover to TomcatB.

10. **Additional Testing (Optional):**
     - Explore more scenarios mentioned in the documentation, such as session invalidation, and observe how clustering handles them.

11. **Monitoring (Optional):**
     - You can monitor your cluster using JMX. Follow the instructions in the documentation to enable JMX monitoring.

12. **FAQ and Troubleshooting (Optional):**
     - Refer to the FAQ section in the documentation for answers to common questions and troubleshooting tips.

This step-by-step guide should help you better understand Tomcat 9 clustering when using Windows 10/11 and Eclipse.
