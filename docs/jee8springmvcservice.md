### Question:
What is the Model-View-Controller plus a Controller-Service Repository?

### Answer:
In the Spring MVC framework, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern is widely used to structure web applications. Let's break down each component and then discuss the addition of a Controller-Service-Repository pattern:

1. **Model**: 
   - The model represents the data of the application and the business logic to manipulate that data. 
   - In a Spring MVC web app, models are typically Java objects that encapsulate the application's state. 
   - These objects can represent entities from a database, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), or any other data structure relevant to the application.

2. **View**: 
   - The view is responsible for presenting the data to the user. 
   - In Spring MVC, views are typically implemented using technologies like JSP (JavaServer Pages), Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker. 
   - Views receive data from the model and render it in a format suitable for presentation to the user.

3. **Controller**: 
   - The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. 
   - It receives incoming requests from the client, invokes the appropriate logic to process the request (often by interacting with the model), and then selects the view to render the response. 
   - In Spring MVC, controllers are typically implemented as Java classes annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController` annotations.

Now, let's introduce the Controller-Service-Repository pattern:

4. **Service**: 
   - In the Controller-Service-Repository pattern, the service layer sits between the controller and the repository. 
   - The service layer contains the business logic of the application. 
   - It orchestrates interactions between multiple repositories (data access objects) and performs any necessary processing on the data before passing it back to the controller. 
   - Services are often implemented as Spring-managed beans, using annotations like `@Service`.

   We can use it for:
   - Validating our data and sending out alerts via E-mail or text if we run into unexpected problems.
   - Adding metadata to our incoming data such as time data country and region. 
   - We are currently persisting to an in-memory "database" but eventually wanting to persist to MariaDB or any other database. By factoring out this business logic into service layers, it will make it easier to re-use the service persistence layer with other client-side input interfaces such as REST or SOAP Services.

5. **Repository**: 
   - The repository layer is responsible for data access and persistence. 
   - It abstracts away the details of how data is stored and retrieved, providing a clean interface for the service layer to interact with the database. 
   - In a Spring MVC application, repositories are typically implemented using Spring Data or custom data access objects (DAOs) and are annotated with `@Repository`.

The Controller-Service-Repository pattern extends the traditional Model-View-Controller architecture by introducing separate layers for business logic (service layer) and data access (repository layer). This separation of concerns improves modularity, maintainability, and testability of the application code.
