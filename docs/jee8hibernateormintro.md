#### **3. Understanding the Hibernate ORM**
- **Introduction**:
  - Hibernate is a popular Java-based ORM framework implementing the JPA specification.
  - It abstracts database interactions, allowing developers to work directly with Java objects.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Automatic Table Mapping**: Maps Java classes to database tables using annotations or XML configurations.
  - **Query Language**: Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and support for native SQL queries.
  - **Caching**: First-level and second-level caching for performance optimization.
  - **Lazy Loading**: Loads associated objects only when accessed.
- **Architecture Overview**:
  - Core components: Session, Transaction, Query, and Configuration.
  - Configuration file (`hibernate.cfg.xml`) or Java-based configuration.
- **Hibernate with JPA**:
  - JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue` are supported.
  - Allows switching between different JPA-compliant providers.
