# 7. Testing Our SOAP Web Service Endpoints

## Introduction

In this course, you will learn how to effectively test a SOAP endpoint. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) relies on a contract-first approach using XSD/XML, which can be challenging. We will guide you through the process of overcoming these challenges and ensure your testing is thorough and efficient.

## 1: How to Test a SOAP Endpoint

### Understanding SOAP Endpoints
- **Definition**: A SOAP endpoint is a web service entry point where clients send SOAP messages.
- **Importance**: Testing ensures that the service meets the specified contract and performs as expected.

### Overcoming the XSD/XML Contract-First Challenge
- **Challenge**: SOAP relies on strict contracts defined by XSD/XML, which can be complex and error-prone.
- **Solution**: Use tools that can parse and validate these contracts automatically, reducing manual errors.

## 2: Choosing a Testing Tool

### Recommended Tools
1. **Eclipse IDE Plugin Tools**
   - **Advantages**: Integrated development environment, supports various plugins for SOAP testing.
   - **Usage**: Suitable for developers who are already using Eclipse for development.
   
2. **Browser Development Tools**
   - **Advantages**: Easy to access, no need for additional software.
   - **Usage**: Quick checks and simple tests, though not as powerful as dedicated tools.

3. **Freeware Tools**
   - **SOAP UI**: 
     - **Advantages**: Comprehensive tool specifically for SOAP and REST testing, with support for automation and scripting.
     - **Usage**: Ideal for detailed testing, including complex scenarios.
   - **Postman**:
     - **Advantages**: Originally designed for REST, but can also be used for SOAP with some configuration.
     - **Usage**: Great for users familiar with Postman who need to test both REST and SOAP.

## 3: Using Our Chosen Testing Tool

### Testing a SOAP Service Using SOAP UI

#### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Download and Install SOAP UI**
   - Go to the [SOAP UI website](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/latest-release.html) and download the latest version.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Create a New SOAP Project**
   - Open SOAP UI and click on `File` > `New SOAP Project`.
   - Enter the project name and the initial WSDL URL.
   - SOAP UI will parse the WSDL and generate the required request templates.

3. **Understanding the Interface**
   - **Project Tree**: Displays your projects, interfaces, operations, and requests.
   - **Request Editor**: Where you compose and send your SOAP requests.
   - **Response Viewer**: Displays the server responses.

4. **Composing a Request**
   - Expand the project tree to find the specific operation you want to test.
   - Double-click on the request to open it in the Request Editor.
   - Fill in the required fields with appropriate values.

5. **Sending the Request**
   - Click on the `Submit` button in the Request Editor.
   - SOAP UI will send the request to the endpoint and display the response in the Response Viewer.

6. **Validating the Response**
   - Ensure the response matches the expected structure and values as defined in the WSDL/XSD.
   - Use assertions to automate response validation (e.g., Schema Compliance, XPath Match).

7. **Handling Errors and Debugging**
   - Analyze error messages to understand issues with the request or response.
   - Use the raw view to see the exact request sent and the response received for troubleshooting.
