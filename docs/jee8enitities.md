### Getting Started with Simple Entities

- **Introduction:**
    
    - Why use JPA for database operations in Java applications?
        
    - Overview of how JPA simplifies database interactions in our Movie DB.
        
- **What We'll Learn:**
    
    - How to define and use JPA entities.
        
    - Basic mapping of Java classes to database tables.
        

2. **Maven Dependencies**

- Key Points:
    
    - Introduce the concept of dependency management in Java projects.
        
    - Highlight essential JPA dependencies needed for our Movie DB project.
        
- Hands-On:
    
    - Adding JPA and MySQL connector dependencies to your pom.xml.
        


xml

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```


3. **Marking an Entity and Mapping it to a Table**

- Concepts:
    
    - What makes a class an entity?
        
    - Using @Entity and @Table annotations.
        
- Example:
    
    - Create a Studio class, marking it as an entity and mapping to the Studio table.
        
 

java

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "Studio")
public class Studio {
    // ... fields and methods
}
```
 

4. **Indicating how JPA Uses Entity Fields**

- Details:
    
    - How fields in your entity correspond to columns in the database.
        
    - The @Column annotation and its purpose.
        
- Practical Example:
    
    - Map the studioName field in the Studio class.
        
  

java

```java
@Column(name = "StudioName")
private String studioName;
```
 

5. **Mapping Surrogate Fields**

- Explanation:
    
    - Surrogate keys in database design.
        
    - How to manage surrogate keys in JPA.
        
- Demo:
    
    - Use of SurrogateKeys table for ID generation.
        
  

6. **Creating Simple ID's**

- Teachings:
    
    - Definition of an ID in JPA.
        
    - @Id and @GeneratedValue annotations.
        
- Implementation:
    
    - Set up auto-generated IDs for Actor entities.
        
  

java

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long actorId;
```
  

7. **Creating Composite ID's**

- Concept:
    
    - When to use composite keys.
        
    - How to define a composite key class in JPA.
        
- Example:
    
    - Create a composite key for the MovieActor junction table.
        

 

java

```java
@Embeddable
public class MovieActorId implements Serializable {
    @Column(name = "MovieId")
    private Long movieId;
    @Column(name = "ActorId")
    private Long actorId;
    // ... equals, hashCode, getters, setters
}
```
  

8. **Using Basic Data Types**

- Discussion:
    
    - Supported data types in JPA.
        
    - Mapping Java types to SQL types.
        
- Illustration:
    
    - Show how different data like String, Date, int, etc., are used in our entities.
        
  

9. **Specifying Column Names and Other Details**

- Details:
    
    - Customizing column names, setting constraints, and other column properties.
        
- Practice:
    
    - Customize column details like nullable, length, unique for various fields.
        
  

java

```java
@Column(name = "ActorName", nullable = false, length = 100, unique = true)
private String actorName;
```
  

Engagement Strategies:

- Scenario-Based Learning: Use real movie industry scenarios to explain why certain JPA configurations are necessary or beneficial.
    
- Interactive Quizzes: After each subtopic, include quizzes or coding challenges to reinforce learning.
    
- Live Coding Sessions: Demonstrate coding examples live, showing how errors occur and how to fix them.
    
- Pair Programming: Encourage students to pair up for some exercises, promoting collaborative learning.
