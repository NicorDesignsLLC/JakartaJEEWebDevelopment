#### **1. What is Data Persistence?**
- **Definition**: Data persistence refers to the mechanism of storing data in a durable medium, such as a database, so that it remains available beyond the runtime of an application.
- **Why It Matters**: 
  - Preserves application state.
  - Enables data recovery in case of system failures.
  - Supports enterprise-scale operations where data must be available long-term.
- **Examples**:
  - Storing user profiles in a database.
  - Saving application settings or transaction records.
