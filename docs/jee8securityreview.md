## **Securing Legacy Java Systems with Spring Security**

### **Course Overview**

This course is tailored for Java developers maintaining or modernizing legacy applications built with Jakarta EE 8 and Spring 5. As enterprise applications evolve, so do the threats they face. Spring Security offers a robust, customizable, and production-proven framework for implementing both fundamental and advanced security features with minimal overhead.

Through practical examples and real-world scenarios, you’ll gain hands-on expertise in securing web applications, REST APIs, and critical business services. Whether you’re integrating with OAuth 2.0 providers, implementing JWT-based stateless sessions, or managing user roles and permissions, this course equips you with the knowledge needed to safeguard your applications.

No prior Spring Security experience is required—this course builds a strong foundation and gradually transitions to advanced integration strategies suitable for real enterprise environments.

### **You Will Learn To:**

✅ Understand the core architecture and filter chain of Spring Security

✅ Implement authentication mechanisms like form login, basic auth, and token-based login

✅ Apply authorization rules with roles, permissions, and expression-based access control

✅ Secure REST endpoints with OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

✅ Integrate Spring Security seamlessly with existing Jakarta EE 8 components

✅ Evaluate alternative security frameworks (e.g., Apache Shiro, Keycloak) and understand why Spring Security often stands out

✅ Protect legacy systems while preparing for migration to Spring Boot or modern stacks

---

### **Who Should Take This Course:**

* Java developers working with legacy Jakarta EE or Spring MVC applications
* Teams responsible for updating authentication and authorization logic
* Architects and engineers planning a migration from monolithic apps to secure microservices
* Developers integrating with third-party identity providers using OAuth 2.0

---

### **Technologies Covered:**

* **Spring 5 Framework** – Foundational enterprise Java development framework
* **Jakarta EE 8** – Key APIs in legacy enterprise systems, including Servlets, JAX-RS, and JSP
* **OpenJDK 11** – Long-term support Java version widely used in production
* **Spring Security** – Main focus of the course
* **OAuth 2.0 & JWT** – Secure, stateless authentication strategies for modern APIs

### **Core Security Concepts**

✅ **Authentication: Verifying User Identity**
Spring Security authenticates users by validating submitted credentials (e.g., username/password, token) against a configured identity store (database, LDAP, external providers). You’ll learn to plug in custom authentication providers and work with the `AuthenticationManager`.

✅ **Authorization: Granting or Denying Access**
Authorization rules define what authenticated users can do. You’ll implement role-based and attribute-based access control using annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`) and expression-based rules.

✅ **Security Filters: The Filter Chain That Processes Requests**
Spring Security processes HTTP requests through a powerful filter chain. You’ll explore how filters like `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`, `BasicAuthenticationFilter`, and `ExceptionTranslationFilter` work together to secure endpoints.

### **Project Setup Checklist**

1️⃣ **Add Spring Security Dependencies**

* Use `spring-boot-starter-security` or manually include Spring Security artifacts for legacy projects.
* Watch for transitive dependencies that might conflict with older Jakarta EE libraries.

2️⃣ **Configure `SecurityFilterChain` (Java Config)**

* Replace deprecated XML and `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` with `@Bean public SecurityFilterChain`.
* Configure HTTP security rules, form login, and custom filters inside this method.

3️⃣ **Disable Deprecated `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`**

* Spring Security 5.7+ treats this class as legacy. You’ll learn how to migrate to a modern, functional-style configuration.

4️⃣ **Set Up Basic Authentication for Initial Testing**

* Start simple: hardcode an in-memory user for rapid feedback.
* Validate your setup by protecting a test controller and accessing it with credentials.

5️⃣ **Pro Tip: Use Spring Initializr to Bootstrap Your Project**

* Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) to scaffold your project with the right dependencies, project structure, and Java version.
* Select “Spring Web” and “Spring Security” for a minimal secure web stack.
