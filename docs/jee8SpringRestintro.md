# Understanding REST Web Services

Web services provide a means for third-party clients to interact with our Spring Web MVC service layer to execute business logic and perform data retrieval or persistence. In the following lesson, we will explore REST web services. Our focus will be on providing and implementing web services, rather than client implementations.

## Modern Context

In the current era of mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), clients often interact with our provided REST web services through client-side JavaScript. This allows for dynamic, real-time communication and functionality.

## Goal of Web Services

The primary goal of web services is to enable seamless interaction and integration of diverse systems over the internet. This capability makes it easier to build distributed applications, leveraging the strengths of different systems and platforms to work together efficiently.

These lessons will guide you through the essentials of web services, helping you understand how to implement them effectively in your projects.
