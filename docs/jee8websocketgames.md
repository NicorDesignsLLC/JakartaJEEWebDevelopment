# 2. Creating Multi-player Games with WebSockets

Welcome to "Creating Multi-player Games with WebSockets." In this course, we'll explore the fascinating world of WebSockets and learn how to build multi-player games using these real-time communication tools. We'll begin by delving into practical examples provided by Tomcat 9, covering WebSocket applications like Echo, Chat, Multiplayer Snake, and Multiplayer Drawboard.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Launch Tomcat 9:** Use the `startup.bat` script from the command line to start your Tomcat 9 server.

2. **Explore WebSocket Examples:** Access the WebSocket examples by visiting [http://localhost:8080/examples/websocket/index.xhtml](http://localhost:8080/examples/websocket/index.xhtml) in your web browser. Here, you'll find a range of WebSocket applications to experiment with.

3. **Local Tomcat 9 Location:** The local instance of Tomcat 9 is located at `C:\apache-tomcat-9.0.68\webapps\examples`. You can refer to this directory for your local WebSocket development.

4. **Source Code on GitHub:** For in-depth understanding and exploration of the source code, check out the WebSocket examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/tree/9.0.x/webapps/examples).

## WebSocket Examples

We'll dive into the following Apache Tomcat WebSocket examples:

1. **Echo Example:** Learn how to create a basic WebSocket application that echoes messages back to the sender.

2. **Chat Example:** Explore a real-time chat application that allows multiple users to communicate instantly.

3. **Multiplayer Snake Example:** Develop a multi-player snake game that showcases the power of WebSockets in gaming.

4. **Multiplayer Drawboard Example:** Create a collaborative drawing board where multiple users can draw and interact in real time.

## Application Integration

In an upcoming section of this course, we'll take the knowledge gained from these examples and apply it to our charity-registration web application. We'll specifically focus on building a real-time chat module, enhancing the user experience and interactivity of our web application.
