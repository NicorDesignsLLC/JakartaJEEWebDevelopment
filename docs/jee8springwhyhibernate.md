2. Why use Hibernator Validator with Spring 5

Using Hibernate Validator as the Bean Validator implementation reference with Spring 5 offers several advantages:

1. **Compatibility**: Hibernate Validator is the reference implementation of the Bean Validation API. Spring Framework integrates seamlessly with Hibernate Validator, making it a natural choice for validation within the Spring ecosystem. This integration ensures smooth interoperability and compatibility between Spring's validation mechanisms and the Bean Validation API.

2. **Robustness and Maturity**: Hibernate Validator is a mature and widely-used validation framework. It has been developed and maintained for many years, accumulating a wealth of features, bug fixes, and optimizations. Its robustness and maturity make it a reliable choice for handling validation requirements in Spring applications.

3. **Feature-rich**: Hibernate Validator provides a rich set of built-in validation constraints and annotations, covering a wide range of common validation scenarios. It supports complex validation rules, such as conditional validation, cross-field validation, and custom validation constraints. This feature richness enables developers to express validation logic succinctly and effectively.

4. **Extensibility**: Hibernate Validator allows for the creation of custom validation constraints and validators, enabling developers to tailor validation logic to their specific application requirements. This extensibility is valuable when dealing with domain-specific validation rules or integrating with third-party libraries.

5. **Community Support**: Being a widely-adopted validation framework, Hibernate Validator benefits from a large and active community of users and contributors. This community support translates to regular updates, documentation improvements, and a wealth of resources available to developers seeking assistance or guidance.

While Spring Framework provides its own validation support through the `@Validated` annotation and the `Validator` interface, Hibernate Validator complements Spring's validation capabilities by offering a standardized and feature-rich implementation of the Bean Validation API. This combination allows developers to leverage the strengths of both frameworks effectively.
