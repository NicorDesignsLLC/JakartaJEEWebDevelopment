# 2. Understanding WebSocket APIs

In this section, we will delve into the WebSocket APIs, focusing on both JavaScript WebSocket clients and Java-based WebSocket clients and servers.

## HTML5 JavaScript Client API

To start, let's explore the HTML5 JavaScript WebSocket Client API. We aim to create an informative and comprehensive tutorial that combines the valuable resources from Mozilla and other references.

### Creating and Using WebSockets

To create a WebSocket connection in your JavaScript application, you can refer to the following online documentation from Mozilla.
Here you can learn how to send and close WebSocket connections with practical examples. 
Explore this section to understand the WebSocket API's core functionality:

[Mozilla WebSocket Client Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications)

### WebSocket Closure Definitions

Understanding WebSocket closure definitions is essential for handling connection closures effectively. Refer to the RFC 6455 specification for in-depth details:

[WebSocket Closure Definitions (RFC 6455 Section 7.4)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-7.4)

## Jakarta JEE8 Java WebSocket APIs

Moving on, let's explore the Java WebSocket APIs, which are an integral part of Jakarta EE 8. This covers both the client and server endpoints.

### Jakarta EE WebSocket Specification

Gain insights into the Jakarta EE WebSocket Specification 2.0 to understand the latest advancements in Java-based WebSocket development:

### Oracle's WebSocket Tutorial

For a more comprehensive understanding of Java WebSocket APIs, you can refer to Oracle's WebSocket tutorial, which provides valuable information and practical examples:

[Oracle Java EE 7 Tutorial - WebSocket](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/websocket.htm)

### WebSocket Server in Java

Learn how to build WebSocket server applications in Java by exploring this Mozilla resource:

[Writing a WebSocket Server in Java](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_a_WebSocket_server_in_Java)

### Java WebSocket API Documentation

For a deep dive into the Java WebSocket API details and classes, consult the official Java EE documentation:
