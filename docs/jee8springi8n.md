# Spring Framework 5 Internationalization in Jakarta EE 8. 

## 1. Why would you want to use Spring i18n in a Jakarta EE 8 web app?
- **Spring i18n:**
    - **Unified Approach**: Spring offers a unified approach to internationalization across various layers of the application, providing consistent handling of messages, formatting, and locale management.
    - **Advanced Features**: Spring's i18n offers additional features such as message formatting, including `MessageFormat` support for dynamic message arguments.
    - **Ease of Use**: Spring's abstractions and APIs (such as `MessageSource` and `LocaleResolver`) simplify internationalization tasks and enhance the ease of use.
    - **Integration**: If you're already using Spring for other aspects of your application, adding Spring's i18n support can provide a seamless and integrated experience.

- **Jakarta EE 8 i18n (JSTL and JSP):**
    - **Standard Features**: Jakarta EE 8 provides standard i18n features using JSTL and JSP, including `fmt` tags to handle localization and formatting.
    - **Straightforward**: For straightforward applications, the standard i18n features offered by Jakarta EE 8 may suffice, as they are built-in and easy to use.
    - **Limited Advanced Features**: Compared to Spring, Jakarta EE 8â€™s i18n capabilities may be less flexible and powerful, particularly when handling complex formatting or message sources.

## 2. How to use Spring i8n APIs in a Jakarta EE 8 web app?
- **Spring i18n:**
    - **Add Spring Dependencies**: Include Spring's i18n and context dependencies in your Jakarta EE project.
    - **Configure `MessageSource`**: Define a `ResourceBundleMessageSource` bean in your Spring configuration to handle messages from resource bundles.
    - **Configure `LocaleResolver`**: Define a `LocaleResolver` bean to handle locale determination (e.g., `SessionLocaleResolver` for session-based locale tracking).
    - **Accessing Messages**: Use Spring's `MessageSource` to retrieve localized messages in your controllers or services.

- **Jakarta EE 8 i18n (JSTL and JSP):**
    - Use JSTL's `fmt` tags in your JSPs to handle localization and formatting.
    - Access resource bundles directly in JSPs using JSTL tags like `<fmt:message>`.

## 3. How to configure Spring i8n in your Jakarta EE 8 web app?
- **Spring i18n:**
    - **Configure Message Source**: Define a `ResourceBundleMessageSource` bean in your Spring configuration, specifying the base name of the resource bundles.
    - **Configure Locale Resolver**: Add a `LocaleResolver` bean, such as `SessionLocaleResolver` or `CookieLocaleResolver`, to manage the current locale.
    - **Add Locale Change Interceptor**: You can add a `LocaleChangeInterceptor` to allow users to change their locale based on a request parameter.

- **Jakarta EE 8 i18n (JSTL and JSP):**
    - Set the default locale in the web application context (`web.xml` or a similar configuration file).
    - Place resource bundles in appropriate locations (e.g., `src/main/resources`).
    - Use JSTL `fmt` tags in JSPs to format dates, numbers, and messages based on the locale.

## 4. How to internationalize an existing Jakarta EE 8 web app with Spring i18n?
- **Convert Resource Bundles**: If you have existing resource bundles in your Jakarta EE 8 app, you can continue to use them in Spring by ensuring the `ResourceBundleMessageSource` points to the same base names.
- **Configure Spring**: Add Spring dependencies and configure the i18n beans (`MessageSource`, `LocaleResolver`, `LocaleChangeInterceptor`) in your Spring context.
- **Update Controllers and Services**: Modify your controllers and services to use Spring's `MessageSource` to retrieve messages instead of using JSP or JSTL tags.
- **Adapt JSPs**: If your application uses JSPs, you may still use JSTL tags for localization, but you might consider transitioning to Spring's templating solutions, such as Thymeleaf, which offer better integration with Spring.
