Jakarta Server Faces (JSF) 2.3 is a Java-based web framework used for creating user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. It's a component-based framework that simplifies the development of Java web applications by providing reusable UI components and a programming model for handling user interactions.

JSF 2.3 is part of the Jakarta EE (Enterprise Edition) platform, which is the successor to Java EE. It was developed as an open-source project under the Eclipse Foundation after Java EE technologies were transferred from Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation in 2017.

JSF 2.3 brings several improvements and features, including:

1. WebSocket Integration: JSF 2.3 offers native support for WebSocket, a communication protocol that enables real-time, two-way communication between clients and servers. This allows the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications.

2. HTML5 Support: The framework provides better support for HTML5 components and features, allowing developers to leverage modern web technologies and markup elements in their JSF-based applications.

3. Improved Templating and Resource Handling: JSF 2.3 includes enhancements to templating capabilities, making it easier to create consistent UI layouts. It also offers improved resource handling, allowing better management and organization of CSS, JavaScript, and other static resources.

4. CDI Integration: JSF 2.3 integrates more seamlessly with CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection), which is the standard dependency injection framework in Java EE. This integration simplifies dependency management, promotes code modularity, and encourages code reusability.

5. Fine-grained AJAX Support: The framework provides enhanced support for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests, allowing developers to update specific parts of the UI without refreshing the entire page. This enhances user experience and improves application performance.

6. Support for Java SE 8: JSF 2.3 embraces the new features introduced in Java SE 8, such as lambda expressions and the new date and time API. These features enable developers to write more concise and expressive code.

JSF 2.3 is a well-established and widely used web framework with a strong community and ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools. It offers developers a powerful and flexible solution for building web applications using Java.
