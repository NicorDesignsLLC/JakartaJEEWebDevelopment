In the context of the Spring framework, including Spring MVC, using logic layer separation with WebSockets involves separating your application's business logic from the WebSocket communication logic. Here's a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

1. **Define Your Business Logic Layer**: In your Spring application, define your business logic layer, which encapsulates the core functionality of your application. This typically includes services, repositories, domain objects, and any other components that handle business rules and data manipulation.

2. **Implement WebSocket Handlers**: Implement WebSocket handlers to manage WebSocket connections, handle messages, and interact with clients. In Spring, you can use the `WebSocketHandler` interface or extend `TextWebSocketHandler` or `BinaryWebSocketHandler` for handling text or binary messages, respectively.

3. **Inject Business Logic Services**: Inject instances of your business logic services into your WebSocket handlers. This allows your WebSocket handlers to interact with the business logic layer to perform operations such as fetching data, processing requests, and sending responses.

4. **Invoke Business Logic from WebSocket Handlers**: Within your WebSocket handlers, invoke methods on your business logic services to perform the necessary operations based on the WebSocket messages received from clients. This ensures that your WebSocket handling code remains focused on communication concerns, while the actual business logic is delegated to dedicated service components.

5. **Separate Concerns**: Ensure clear separation of concerns between your WebSocket handling code and the underlying business logic. Avoid coupling WebSocket-related code with business logic implementation details to maintain modularity and facilitate future changes and enhancements.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate how you can structure your Spring application to achieve logic layer separation with WebSockets:

```java
// Business Logic Layer
@Service
public class ChatService {
    public void processChatMessage(String message) {
        // Process and handle chat message logic
    }
}

// WebSocket Handler
@Component
public class ChatWebSocketHandler extends TextWebSocketHandler {

    @Autowired
    private ChatService chatService;

    @Override
    protected void handleTextMessage(WebSocketSession session, TextMessage message) throws Exception {
        String payload = message.getPayload();
        // Invoke business logic to process chat message
        chatService.processChatMessage(payload);
        // Handle other WebSocket-related tasks as needed
    }
}

// WebSocket Configuration
@Configuration
@EnableWebSocket
public class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketConfigurer {

    @Autowired
    private ChatWebSocketHandler chatWebSocketHandler;

    @Override
    public void registerWebSocketHandlers(WebSocketHandlerRegistry registry) {
        registry.addHandler(chatWebSocketHandler, "/chat");
    }
}
```

In this example, `ChatService` encapsulates the business logic related to processing chat messages. The `ChatWebSocketHandler` class handles WebSocket communication and delegates the processing of incoming chat messages to the `ChatService`. The `WebSocketConfig` class configures WebSocket endpoints and associates them with the appropriate WebSocket handlers.

This approach ensures that WebSocket-related concerns are separated from the core business logic of the application, promoting maintainability, scalability, and code reusability.
