# Using the XML Processing Tag Library


The XML library taglib directive:

	<%@ taglib prefix="x" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/xml" %>

However the changes are good that you will run into this tag library and technology given
its prominence in the Java world prior to the adoption of json and yaml
